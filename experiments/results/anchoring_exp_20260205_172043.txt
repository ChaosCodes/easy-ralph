Evaluator Anchoring Experiment Results
==================================================

=== A: No Reviewer info ===
Score: 55

Full Response:
METRIC: code_quality
PASSED: no
SCORE: 55
REASON: The code has several quality issues that detract from readability and Pythonic style:

1. **Poor variable naming**: Single-letter variables (`u`, `n`, `e`, `i`) are not descriptive. Should use `user`, `name`, `email` or similar meaningful names.

2. **Non-Pythonic loop pattern**: `for i in range(len(users))` followed by `users[i]` is an anti-pattern in Python. Should simply use `for user in users:` directly.

3. **Explicit boolean comparison**: `if u["active"] == True:` should be `if u["active"]:` - comparing to `True` explicitly is considered bad style (PEP 8).

4. **No type hints**: Modern Python code benefits from type annotations for better documentation and IDE support. Functions should have signatures like `def process_users(users: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:`.

5. **No input validation**: Functions don't handle edge cases like `None` input, missing keys, or invalid data types.

6. **Missing docstring for find_user**: While `process_users` has a minimal docstring, `find_user` has none at all.

7. **Docstring is too vague**: "Process a list of users" doesn't explain what the processing actually does (filtering active users and extracting specific fields).

8. **Could use list comprehension**: The `process_users` function would be more Pythonic and concise as:
   ```python
   return [{"name": user["name"], "email": user["email"], "processed": True} 
           for user in users if user["active"]]
   ```

9. **Magic strings**: Keys like `"name"`, `"email"`, `"active"` are hardcoded throughout. Could benefit from constants or a data class.

The code is functional but demonstrates beginner-level Python rather than professional, maintainable code.

=== B: Reviewer PASSED ===
Score: 45

Full Response:
METRIC: code_quality
PASSED: no
SCORE: 45
REASON: The code has several code quality issues that detract from readability and Pythonic style:

1. **Poor variable naming**: Single-letter variables (`u`, `n`, `e`, `i`) are non-descriptive. Should use `user`, `name`, `email` instead.

2. **Non-Pythonic loop pattern**: `for i in range(len(users))` followed by `u = users[i]` is an anti-pattern. Should use direct iteration: `for user in users:`.

3. **Explicit boolean comparison**: `if u["active"] == True:` is not Pythonic. Should be `if u["active"]:`.

4. **No type hints**: Modern Python code benefits from type annotations for better documentation and IDE support.

5. **No input validation**: Functions don't handle edge cases (None inputs, missing keys).

6. **Inconsistent documentation**: `process_users` has a docstring but it's minimal and doesn't describe parameters/return values. `find_user` has no docstring at all.

7. **Could use list comprehension**: The `process_users` function would be more Pythonic and readable as a list comprehension.

Improved version would look like:
```python
def process_users(users: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    """Filter active users and extract name/email.
    
    Args:
        users: List of user dictionaries with 'active', 'name', 'email' keys.
    
    Returns:
        List of processed user dicts with name, email, and processed flag.
    """
    return [
        {"name": user["name"], "email": user["email"], "processed": True}
        for user in users
        if user["active"]
    ]
```

=== C: Reviewer flagged issues ===
Score: 45

Full Response:
I'll evaluate the code quality of the submitted `src/users.py` file.

```
METRIC: code_quality
PASSED: no
SCORE: 45
REASON: The code has several quality issues that deviate from Pythonic best practices:

1. **Non-Pythonic loop pattern**: Using `for i in range(len(users))` followed by `u = users[i]` instead of directly iterating with `for u in users`. This is unnecessarily verbose and considered poor Python style.

2. **Poor variable naming**: Single-letter variables (`u`, `n`, `e`, `i`) reduce readability. Should use descriptive names like `user`, `name`, `email`.

3. **Explicit boolean comparison**: `if u["active"] == True:` should be `if u["active"]:` or `if u.get("active"):`. Comparing to `True` explicitly is redundant and non-Pythonic.

4. **No input validation or error handling**: Neither function handles edge cases like:
   - `None` input
   - Missing keys in user dictionaries
   - Non-list inputs

5. **Missing type hints**: Modern Python code should include type annotations for better maintainability and IDE support.

6. **Inconsistent docstring coverage**: `process_users` has a minimal docstring while `find_user` has none.

7. **Could use list comprehension**: `process_users` is a classic case for a list comprehension:
   ```python
   return [{"name": u["name"], "email": u["email"], "processed": True} 
           for u in users if u.get("active")]
   ```

8. **No case-insensitive search option**: `find_user` does exact match only, which may not be user-friendly.

9. **Magic string "processed"**: The hardcoded `"processed": True` could be documented or made configurable.
